Instructions for the Code
The tweet collection is done through a Twitter API and can only be accessed if you apply for the Twitter API using the access codes given. Other than that, the code is smooth and 
only requires the empirical data files that are given. Also, with the Twitter sentiment, the code was created for 2021-03-28 to 2021-04-01 and this data would not be available based 
on the restrictions of the Twitter API. The data for the Twitter collection only goes around 5 days into the past and so from the 18th of April, you could collect data from approximately 
April 12th-13th onwards. So in order to review the data, the dates for the function search_tweets would need to be changed to more recent dates in order to view the Twitter data. Along 
with the need to change the Twitter search for more recent tweets, the stock data needs to be adjusted to that accommodate the same time in order to get a better forecast with up to date 
data. Last, the data with the packages that need to be installed are included in AAPL's R data file and this is the first file that needs to be run in order to obtain the data.
